* Loam

I'm trying to learn how to make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike][Roguelikes]] in Common Lisp. I'm
slightly following in the footsteps of Steve Losh's impressive [[https://github.com/sjl/silt2/blob/master/silt.lisp][=silt=]],
though I expect this to veer off in unexpected directions.

Right now I'm mostly figuring out basic Common Lisp and =curses= stuff, without worrying too much about what the game will become.

** Build & Run

It probably only builds and runs on Mac so far. First, set up your Mac
with SBCL. My notes for that are [[http://johnj.com/lisp-projects.html][here]].

Then,
#+BEGIN_SRC
make   # to build
./loam # to run
#+END_SRC

Hitting the =q= key quits the game.

** Next Steps

- Tolerate resizes of windows larger than world size
- Draw a little bit of tooltip text when objects are encountered
- Start thinking about some simple game play
